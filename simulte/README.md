# OpenCV2X - SimuLTE only i.e. Veins based simulations
OpenCV2X enables simulation of V2X scenarios based on the 3GPP CV2X Mode 4 standard through an extension of the SimuLTE framework. It also allows for simulation with the ETSI ITS-G5 standard application layers through an integration with Artery which implements these standards for OMNeT++.
